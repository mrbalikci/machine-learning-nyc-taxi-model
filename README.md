# NYC TAXI DEMEND PREDICTIONS 

Use TensorFlow to create a neural network model to forecast taxicab demand in NYC. Tools: Google Cloud, Python, TensorFlow

## Details 
In this lab, continue the Datalab notebook from previous lab to create a TensorFlow neural network to predict taxicab demand.

### Objective 

- Use TensorFlow to create a neural network model to forecast taxicab demand in NYC

### Introduction

- Build a demand forecast system using machine learning. Use this data to train a TensorFlow neural network that can then predict the demand on days in the future given those features as input.
